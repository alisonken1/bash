F.A.C.T.S. output to laserjet conversion scripts.

Convert F.A.C.T.S. (Basis International Business Basic program) text output
to postscript for clean printouts to laserjet printers.

Original scripts are written for Bash v3.1 as used by Slackware v12.0.

Postscript output is designed for Abletronics (http://abletronics.com)
internal use.

This is a refactoring of the multiple scripts originally created piecemeal
when old printing system of dot-matrix printers and multi-page continuous
feed paper were replaced with laserjet printers.
